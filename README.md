## Alrternative Execution (Containerisation)

## Docker Image

I sought to build this project on the miniconda base image and add layers to it to build and improved version with analysis and data there in. This will be useful to run in any environment without a lag in dependencies. The analysis can also be worked on a web based server.

You can pull this image from docker hub and run it with the following instruction

Go to the link :
<https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/christinemuthee/jupyterlab> and head to christinemuthee/jupyterlab
To pull the image from docker type : <docker pull christinemuthee/jupyterlab> on your terminal to get ready to build a container from it.
